🤠  Fun fact: I have always wanted to learn how to play Bridge, the card game! Please reach out if you know how to play or want somebody to learn with.

💬  As a recent graduate from The Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, I plan to represent the LGBTQ+ community in Big Tech as a Software Engineer. I hope to inspire and spread awareness to other women+, letting them know that they, too, are capable of being Software Engineers!
