## Hi there! I'm Laura ✌

####  💬  Elevator Pitch: 
Prior to coding, I always found myself itching to contribute more. Shortly after completing a few online workshops and probing some engineers at work, I started piecing together how to make my dream career a reality.

Toward the end of 2020 a small investment (₿) allowed me to save enough money to enroll in the App Academy Bootcamp Prep course. With no turning back, I studied every day and was accepted to The Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy in March 2021.

I plan to represent the LGBTQ+ community in Big Tech as a Software Engineer. I hope to inspire and spread awareness to other women+, letting them know that they, too, are capable of being software engineers.

####  📅 Day-to-day:
I’m a Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York City and a competitive Triathlete.
